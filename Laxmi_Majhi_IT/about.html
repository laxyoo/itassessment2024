                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I'm Laxmi, a dedicated student of Computer Science at British College, passionate about technology and design. My journey in tech started when I was just twelve, driven by curiosity and a love for creating something out of nothing.</p>

                    <h2>My Interests</h2>
                    <p>Outside the digital world, I am an avid photographer and hiker. These hobbies take me places, both literally and figuratively, allowing me to capture moments of beauty and tranquility. They also inspire my designs, bringing a fresh perspective to my work.</p>
                    <p>I believe in continuous learning and am always exploring new technologies and techniques to expand my skill set. Iâ€™m also keen on collaborating with like-minded individuals to enhance our collective knowledge and output.</p>
                    <h2>Connect with Me</h2>
